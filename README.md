# Pre-processing

# Jenkins
- Jenkinsfile replaced with myJenkins.sh
- Appears to be triggered by a pull request ok
- Can be manually triggered
- Integrated with workspace cleanup plugin (Had to be a freestyle project - ie. Jenkinsfile-based pipeline not working)
- TO DO: If testing fails, does it report as a fail?
