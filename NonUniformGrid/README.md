## Non-uniform Grid Generation

This Python code is able to generate a non-uniform grid according
to the domain specified on the `params_vel.py` file generated by
the Velocity Model code.

### Usage


Execute `generate_non_uniform_grid.py` by specifying the `params_vel.py`,
`population_grid.csv` and `Vs_500_200m.csv` files. 

This will produde a `.ll` file with the name given as `non_uniform_LonLat_ResolSuffix.ll` where
Lon and Lat are the Longitude and Latitude of the centre of the domain, Resol is the resolution of
the Velocity Model and `Suffix` is a suffix specified if any.


### Remarks

- This code has a binary version of `xy2ll` and `ll2xy` that should be usable, however
if this does not work, one needs to specify them.
