## Non-uniform Grid Generation

This Python code is able to generate a non-uniform grid according
to the domain specified on the `params_vel.py` file generated by
the Velocity Model code.

### Usage

Execute `generate_non_uniform_grid.py` by specifying the velocity parameters, `population_grid.csv` and `Vs_500_200m.csv` files found on
`/inputs`. Finally, you should define a minimal grid spacing in Kilometers. Typically, you will do something like:
```buildoutcfg
python generate_non_uniform_grid.py whole_nz.py inputs/population_grid.csv inputs/Vs_500_200m.csv 0.1
```

To generate the non-uniform grid corresponding to the whole NZ, use `whole_nz.py`. Otherwise you can
just create a non-uniform grid for the South Island (`south_island.py`).

Running the code will produde a `.ll` file with the name given as `non_uniform_params_vel_Suffix.ll` where
 `Suffix` is a suffix specified `-hhMinimal_spacing` (for example )

After generating a new grid, it is necessary to re-create the corresponding vs_30 files.

- TODO: Automate all the process by writing a wrapper.
- TODO: Parallelize the generation of the non-uniform grid

### Remarks

- This code has a binary version of `xy2ll` and `ll2xy` that should be usable, however
if this does not work, one needs to specify them.
